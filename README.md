Exploring Sales Data in SQL and Tableau | RFM Analysis in SQL 

## RFM ANALYSIS
 <strong> Recency-Frequency-Monetary (RFM) </strong> <br>
 It is an indexing technique that uses past purchase behavior to segment customers. <br>
 An RFM report is a way of segmenting customers using three key metrics: <br>
	- recency (how long ago their last purchase was),<br>
	- frequency (how often they purchase), and <br>
	- monetary value (how much they spent). <br>
