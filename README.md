## RFM ANALYSIS
 <strong> Recency-Frequency-Monetary (RFM) </strong> <br>
 It is an indexing technique that uses past purchase behavior to segment customers. An RFM report is a way of segmenting customers using three key metrics: <br>
* recency (how long ago their last purchase was) <br>
* frequency (how often they purchase) <br>
* monetary value (how much they spent) <br>
