##RFM ANALYSIS
 ##Recency-Frequency-Monetary (RFM)
 It is an indexing technique that uses past purchase behavior to segment customers.
 An RFM report is a way of segmenting customers using three key metrics:
	- recency (how long ago their last purchase was),
	- frequency (how often they purchase), and
	- monetary value (how much they spent).
